Contributing is not just for developers! There are many opportunities to help with [testing](#getting-started), triage, discussion, designing and building variations, and more. Please look through [open issues](https://github.com/leogopal/simplifii/issues), and join in wherever you feel most comfortable.

== Tips for Contributors ==

- Similar to Simplifii, a goal for the theme is to have as little CSS as possible. Much of the theme's visual treatments should be handled by the Block Editor and Global Styles. As a general rule, if multiple themes would benefit from the CSS you're considering adding, it might reasonably be provided by Gutenberg instead. Let's include clear code comments for any CSS we do include.
- Similarly, let's refrain from building any custom-built PHP or JavaScript-based workarounds for functionality that might reasonably be provided by the Block Editor. Simplifii will be a block theme, so let's keep its code simple.
- In accordance to those last two bullets, this theme has no required build process.
- If you've helped contribute to the theme in any way, you deserve credit! Folks will be updating [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) periodically with names of contributors, but feel free to open a PR or issue if we leave someone out.

== Requirements ==

- Gutenberg plugin (latest)
- WordPress 6.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- License: [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) or later

Some theme features / PRs may require Gutenberg trunk and will be described or tagged accordingly.
